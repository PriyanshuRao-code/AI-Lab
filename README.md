# 🧠 AI Laboratory Work – IIT Dharwad

This repository contains the laboratory assignments completed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence course** at IIT Dharwad. The labs progressively build understanding of **data preprocessing, visualization, supervised and unsupervised learning, and neural networks**.

Each lab focuses on applying concepts to real datasets using **Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/PyTorch)**.
